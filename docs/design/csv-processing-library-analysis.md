# CSV Processing Library Analysis

This document analyzes CSV processing libraries to inform a decision as to
which to use in the effayoh library.

## Purpose of the csv processing library

The lowest level of data processing in the library is the published UN FAO
data. This data is in CSV format. A library that allows intuitive, easy and
fast manipulation of the FAO data sheets will greatly facilitate the library's
implementation and use.

### Requirements

- The csv processing library must be simple and intuitive yet flexible and
  powerful.
- The library must be open source.
- The library must not have a complicated installation.
- The library should have few or no dependencies.
